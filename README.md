Translator from C to Python3 and compiler of C to MIPS

Includes:
-test_translator.sh which tests the translator against the test cases in c_translator_tests
-test_compiler.sh which tests the compiler against the test_deliverable (in capitals), and a handful of other tests (func_call, mul)


Compiler supports basic implementation

Function calls resulted in a segmentation fault which I couldn't figure out in time.
