- `schedule.csv`:

  _week by week schedule of milestones with planned and actual effort_

- `effort-log.csv`:

  _a log of the actual effort expended whilst doing the project_

---------------------------
**Reflection:** (supplementary to effort-log)


- Struggled to find where to begin with the compiler: had to do a lot of research into MIPS instructions and a lot of trial and error using the mips-linux-gnu-gcc as reference

- Implementing just the primary functionality was much harder and took much longer than expected, very different approach to the simple one that was used for the translator

- Had to revise targets for the the complexity of the compiler due to difficulties with timing (a week during the middle of the project was missed due to external circumstances)

- Again had to revise targets for implementation of the compiler due to the lexer/parser/AST not having support for arrays for loops pointers etc

- Had to revisit and refine compile functions for various structures in the AST whilst running into problems along the way
